# OMISS-Awards
Excel template to calculate OMISS awards based on imported ADI logs.
For more information on these awards and how to become a member, please visit https://www.omiss.net/

Originally written by Mike Maddox (KI6WOX) and recently updated by Paul Reedy (KA5PMV), this template will read your imported ADI files and generate results for each OMISS award.

Download the files.  Add your call sign and OMISS number to the OC_Config tab, press the Download Rosters button, and you're ready to go.  Then you can run a script for each award you're interested in, to see how close you are to completing that award.

## Compatibility

This has been tested on Windows and Mac with the latest version of Excel.
It does not work on Excel 2010.

## Note

There's been some requests for this to be available either in Google Sheets or OpenOffice.  
Mike has provided me with an Open Office version of the template.  I'm going to work on it to bring it up to date like the Excel template, then I'll post it here.
