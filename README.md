# OMISS-Awards
Excel and OpenOffice calc templates to calculate OMISS awards based on imported ADI contact logs.
For more information on these awards and how to become a member, please visit https://www.omiss.net/

A video walkthrough on how to use the spreadsheets is located here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBXyA3ZQAcg

Originally written by Mike Maddox and recently updated by Paul Reedy (KA5PMV), this template will read your exported ADI files from Netlogger and generate results for each OMISS award.

* Download the files.  
* Add your call sign and OMISS number to the OC_Config tab, 
* Import your ADI file from Netlogger (or other logging software such as N3FJP logger using the "Other" field using the format: 
`"OMISS OM#"` where OM# is the Omiss number of the station you worked)'
* Click "Run All Awards" button, to see how close you are to completing all of the awards.
* From then on, just add your new contacts from each day as you make them, select your new contacts ADI file, and read those in.  Do Not import the same contacts again, as that will create duplicates.

## Compatibility

This has been tested on Windows and Mac with the latest version of Excel and OpenOffice Calc.
It does not work on Excel 2010 or older.
